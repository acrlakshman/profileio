## [Degassing](https://rohitmishranitrr.github.io/EOR)

* Highlights:
  * Empirical shear thinning power law model developed for polymers in porous media simulation
  * Finds viscosity at any concentration as a function of space and time
  * 2nd invariant of Deformation tensor used to find shear rate and relate to viscosity
  * Two polymer widely used in Enhanced Oil Recovery compared: Schizophyllan and Xanthane
