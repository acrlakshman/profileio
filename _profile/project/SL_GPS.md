## [SL-GPS for chemical mechanism reduction](https://rohitmishranitrr.github.io/SL_GPS)

* Highlights:
  * Developed an adaptive Global Pathway Selection scheme for improving the speed and accuracy of classic GPS
  * Trained an Artifical Neural Network (ANN) to retain the accuracy of the adaptive GPS but improve the speed
  * Developed ANN architecture able to capture key combustion metrics like Ignition Delay (ID) and Heat Release Rate (HRR)
  * Algorithm and ANN architecture shown below; More details in published paper.
