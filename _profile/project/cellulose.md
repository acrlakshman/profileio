## [Surface film and splash drop prediction for understanding nanoparticle deposition](https://rohitmishranitrr.github.io/cellulose)

* Highlights:
  * Ran simulations for estimating the surface film and splash metrics for understanding the cellulose deposition
  * Predictions show a critical injection distance for ideal deposition (more details in the published paper)
