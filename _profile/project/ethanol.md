## [Reduced Ethanol Mechanisms](https://openengg1.github.io/ethanol)

* Highlights:
  * Reduced the PCRL-Mech1 mechanism to find reduced-low, reduced-wide and reduced-high mechanisms
  * Generated mechanisms were validated for 0D, 1D and 3D simulations
  * High speedups with the desired accuracy found for all the generated mechanisms
  * Highly useful for full scale ethanol 3D CFD combustion simulations for study of ethanol combustion relevant for the decarbonization efforts
