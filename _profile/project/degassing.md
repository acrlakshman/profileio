* [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468087421993348)
* Highlights:
  * New solubility based degassing model was developed in OpenFOAMv6
  * Works in a three component framework with individual velocities for air, vapor and liquid fuel components
  * Mesh sensitivity study was performed
  * Parameteric study was performed for Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model and degassing model
  * New model has been validated against the data
  * New model performs well and is able to capture the degassing and cavitation effects

* Highlights:
  * Dynamic meshing capability in OFv6 has been explored for Cummins injector nozzle
  * Full simulation ran for three pressures: 900bar, 1200bar, 1800bar
  * Cavitation observed at different times for different injector pressures
