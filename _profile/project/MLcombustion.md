## [ML for flamelet tables](https://openengg1.github.io/MLcombustion)

* Highlights:
  * Working with Prof. Dorrin Jarrahbashi and Sarvesh Mayilvahanan (Undergraduate student at Texas A&M University)
  * Created 4D flamelet tables to train the ML algorithm
  * Used TensorFlow to test different clustering algorithms along with DNN for identifying manifolds
  * New model can predict the missing data with lower MAE
  * Future work will involve creating 5D tables with pressure being a variable
