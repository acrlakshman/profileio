* Highlights:
  * Created 4D flamelet tables to train the ML algorithm
  * Used TensorFlow to test different clustering algorithms along with DNN for identifying manifolds
  * New model can predict the missing data with lower MAE
  * Future work will involve creating 5D tables with pressure being a variable
