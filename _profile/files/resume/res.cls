%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% You can have multiple style options the legal options ones are:
%
%   centered	the name and address are centered at the top of the
%		page (default)
%
%   line	the name is the left with a horizontal line then 
%		the address to the right
%
%   overlapped	the section titles overlap the body text (default)
%
%   margin	the section titles are to the left of the body text
%		
%   11pt	use 11 point fonts instead of 10 point fonts
%
%   12pt	use 12 point fonts instead of 10 point fonts
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   Commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   \Resume	prints the word resume but typeset nicely
%
%   \newsectionwidth{dimen}
%		defines the amount of space the labels extend
%		into the left margin.
%		DO NOT TRY to change any of the dimensions
%		yourself.  You will probably confuse the style file.
%
%   \name{text} defines your name
%
%   \address{text}
%		defines your address
%		this can be called twice if you have two addresses
%		use \\'s to indicate where either line breaks or
%		comas should go
%
%   \opening	this prints your name and address at that spot
%		this is not normally needed, as \begin{resume}
%		does this but is provided just in case you need
%		to do something odd
%
%   \begin{resume} ... \end{resume}
%		all of the resume should go inside of this
%		environment
%
%   \section{text}
%		This prints 'text' in the left hand margin.
%		Its exact placement depends on what the style 
%		options has been set to. (overlapped or margin)
%		You should use \\ to start a new line.	If the
%		style option is margin, the \\ is converted
%		to a space.
%		To use this in any of the list environments, put
%		the \section after the \item[] but before the 
%		text.
%		Eg.
%		\begin{itemize}
%		\item\section{text}
%		text
%		\end{itemize}
%
%   \begin{ncolumn}{n} ... \end{ncolumn}
%		creates a tabular environment with n equally
%		spaced columns.  Separate columns by & and
%		end them with \\
%
%   \begin{position} ... \end{position}
%		this is used to print a job description.  There should
%		be only one job description in it.  Information
%		related to the job (such as title, dates...) will
%		be printed.
%
%   \begin{format} ... \end{format}
%		used to change the default format for the position
%		environment.  Within it the recognized commands are:
%		\title{option}
%		\employer{option}
%		\location{option}
%		\dates{option}
%		\body
%		\\
%		where option is one of l,r,c standing for left, right, center.
%		The format will eventually be used to make several
%		tabular environments and you are defining the number of columns
%		and the placement of text within the columns of the tabulars.
%		Each row is terminated by a \\.  Any number of options can 
%		be on a line, they will each be set in their own columns.
%		Any of the options except \body may be left out.
%
%		Eg.
%		\begin{format}
%		\title{l}\employer{r}\\
%		\dates{r}\\
%		\body\\
%		\location{l}\\
%		\end{format}
%
%		In this example the title and employer information
%		are set in 2 columns left justified and right justified
%		respectively.  Then the date is set right justified.
%		Then the body is set.  Then the location is set left
%		justified.
%
% \employer{text}
% \title{text}
% \dates{text}
% \location{text}
%		declare text for the next invocation of the position
%		environment
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Glue
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% sectionskip	the amount of horizontal before a section
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Dimensions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% sectionwidth	the amount that the section titles go in the
%		left margin
%
% resumewidth	the width of the total resume from the left
%		margin to the right.  Don't use textwidth
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Definitions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% sectionfont	the font used to print section titles
%		use \renewcommand to change it
%
% namefont	the font used to print your name
%		use \renewcommand to change it
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% THINGS TO DO
%
% add lm,rm options to format style to allow things to be placed
% in the left or right margin respectivly
%
% add capability so that \body doesn't have to be proceeded (followed)
% by a \\ allowing part of the description (eg. location) to be the
% first (last) thing of the body
%
% clean up the list building procedures
%
% write docs to tell people how to use this
